A video summarization app. This project won "Most Liked" in University of Colorado Boulder's annual hackathon, HackCU, in 2018.

It uses Harvard's OpenNMT machine learning platform to summarize inputted text files. To start the project, we decided to summarize the translation text of Youtube Videos by inputting the text into the machine learned algorithms. We also experimented with a text summarizing machine learning algorithm developed by Google Researcher's with TensorFlow.
